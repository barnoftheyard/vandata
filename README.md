# Vandata

### Project is depricated! No longer works with Godot 4. Please check the newest interation of my FPS godot project, Gladio: 
https://github.com/barnoftheyard/gladio-godot

### What is this?
An in-development fast-action Godot FPS game featuring multiplayer, physics, ~~Qodot/Quake map intergration~~ in the vein of Valve's Half-Life.

### Features:
* Simple TCP/IP multiplayer networking deathmatch, with text chat and physics synchronization. 
* Six fully implemented weapons, such as the pistol, smg, BR, bow, grenade, and shovel.
* Full player animations done by me.
* Hostile and passive actors/mobs.
* Console debug system.
* Custom map entities, such as physics.
And much more coming soon!

### Is it done?
Not yet. Code wise a lot of what I want to implement is about ~70% done (as of 2/1/21), multiplayer still has lots of work ahead. Art is totally unfinished and either in mock up, or infancy.
### How do I keep in touch?
I'll plan to have a small community once the game becomes somewhat playable, either through Discord or a forum. Until then you can contact me at taticalfacepalm1.a@gmail.com
