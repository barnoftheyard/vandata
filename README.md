# Vandata
### What is this?
An in-development fast-action Godot FPS game featuring multiplayer, physics, Qodot/Quake map intergration in the vein of Valve's Half-Life.
### Is it done?
Not yet. Code wise a lot of what I want to implement is about ~70% done (as of 2/1/21), multiplayer still has lots of work ahead. Art is totally unfinished and either in mock up, or infancy.
### How do I keep in touch?
I'll plan to have a small community once the game becomes somewhat playable, either through Discord or a forum. Until then you can contact me at bseifert@hvare.xyz
